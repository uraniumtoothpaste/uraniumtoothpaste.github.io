Two figures framed by a sunset clasp hands.

---
# Elieen
I'm so happy for you!
---
# Elieen
Heard about the job in Verlstad!
---
# Hiromi
Thank you!
---
# Hiromi
I feel miles high!
---
# Elieen
"What are thanks between sisters?"
---
# Hiromi
"…But kisses and hugs?"
---

Laughing, the two of you hold each other steady.

---
# H
Thats the best line from "Purple Bonds"!
---
# E
"Only by leaps and bounds!"
---
# H
"... And boundless leaps!"
---

More laughing

---
# H
We're the worst!
---
# E
Speak for yourself
---
# H
Psh! Whatevver.
---

Silence

---
# H
So...
---
# E
So...
---
# E
When do you leave?
---
# H
On the thrird—next week.
---
# E
So soon?
---
# H
Yeah, they're excited to have me and really need a swordsmith.
---
# E
They can't wait a month?
---
# H
They can't.
---
# H
Their batallion will mobilize in two months.
---
# H
So they need every weapon I can forge.
---
# E
The Kvardi seem to have advanced faster than last year.
---
# H
Narlu thinks it's because Winter was too warm.
---
# H
Of *course* Sefem disagrees...
---
# E
Pah, *of course*!
---
# H
...and thinks something is pushing the Kvardi over the passes
---
# E
Lets speak of other things...
---
# H
Things like that cutie who appritinced to Koram's shop?
---
# narrator
Elieen hits you on the shoulder
---
# E
No! Not things like that!
---
# H
Spill girl! Spill!
---
# Percival
“Hey, Hiromi,” calls a gravelly voice.
---
# Percival
We need you to check the pig iron before we box it.
---
# H
You turn to your sister, “Duty calls.”
---

Forlorn glances are exchanged.

---
# E
Go, be the swordsmith.
---
# E
Make sure it's the best god damn pig iron we have.
---
# H
Always. 
--
*Always*
---
# H
Farewell my sister.
