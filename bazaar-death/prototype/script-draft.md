You are in town for a writing convention.
---
It ends early in the afternoon.
---

You’re only here until tomorrow evening, so you decide to make the most of it, and peruse the historical city; taking in its sights. 
---

You walk along the shops facing the river and treat yourself to a few historical tours. 
---

By the end of your third tour the sky grows dark. 
---

You decide to end your day and head back to your hotel. 
---
As you turn down the road that leads to your hotel, you see bright flashing lights and yellow tape. 
---

There appears to have been an accident of some sort. 
---

Ahead of you lies another way back—through a bazaar. 
---

You cross the street into the brightly lit market. 
---

You push your way through the crowds, but there doesn’t seem to be a way out. 
---

Adjacent streets only seem lead to more open storefronts or dead ends. 
---

You turn to find your way back <!-- to the open street --> only to realize that you don’t know which way you came through. 
---

You wander, trying to find something familiar, but the people pushing past you in every direction are disorienting. 
---

You decide you must ask for help. 
---

You walk up to a colorful shopfront with dozens of glass vials labeled with various oils and Vitamix blenders on tiered shelves.
---

On a podium, next to the cash register, is a bong.
---

Behind the bong is a bipedal goat with a mop of curly brown hair. 
---

He blows smoke from his mouth before offering an enthusiastic 

“Shalom!”
